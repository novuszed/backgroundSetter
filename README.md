Script that crawls Reddit's earthporn section for images to be displayed as background for Mac OSX. It parses the website and downloads
any photos on the front page that hasn't been downloaded before and store them in a folder. It then calls a cron job that is set at
an hourly pace to change the background picture for Mac.
